# Advent of Code 2021 in Rust

This is me getting familiar with the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by solving the
programming puzzles of [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Each day has its own crate. To run the code of a day,
[install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), change into the
directory of the day and run `cargo run` (you can add `--release` to run an
optimized build). The puzzle answers of the two tasks for the day are printed
to stdout.

There are some pieces of commented code which achieve the same thing as the
code that is run. Their sole purpose is to document different approaches in
Rust, while I am learning.
